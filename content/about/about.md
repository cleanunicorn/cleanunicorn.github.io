I am Daniel Luca (aka CleanUnicorn), based in Bucharest, Romania, a self-taught **software engineer**, **Ethereum security auditor** and **investor** working in the blockchain space **since 2017**.

With a deep passion for open-source technologies, security, and Artificial Intelligence, I bring a practitioner’s mindset to every project. I prioritize trust-minimized architectures and rigorous code reviews to ensure systems hold up under real adversarial conditions, rather than relying on short-lived narratives.

This deep technical foundation eventually pulled me into **venture capital**, where I now operate at the intersection of blockchain, AI, and security. I focus on research-driven technical due diligence and deal sourcing, utilizing my background as a Blockchain Architect to support founders well beyond the initial check. Whether I am auditing code or evaluating a seed round, **my philosophy remains rooted in open-source technologies and long-term fundamentals**. I am committed to building and backing resilient, secure solutions that drive the industry forward through sound engineering practices.

## Projects

### [Rag-brain](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/rag-brain)
Portable private AI memory built as a vector database and MCP server, easily pluggable into chatbots.

### [Quill](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/quill)
Command-line tool for transcribing audio files, YouTube videos, and podcasts using Faster Whisper.

### [Karl](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/karl)
Monitors smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum network and tests against vulnerabilities with Mythril. Reduces false positives by forking the blockchain and testing the exploit.

### [Multistream](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/multistream)
A Node.js RTMP server that receives streams from OBS and restreams them to multiple platforms simultaneously like Twitch, YouTube, Kick. Has features to automatically record and transcribe, identifies clippable moments and helps generate short clips.

### [RL-Swarm](https://github.com/gensyn-ai/rl-swarm-contracts)
This repository contains the smart contracts for the [RL Swarm](https://www.gensyn.ai/RLSwarm) [Gensyn](https://www.gensyn.ai/)'s project which lets anyone, anywhere, join and participate in a distributed reinforcement learning system that learns faster together than alone.

### [Ethereum Smart Contract Template](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/ethereum-smartcontract-template)
This development quick start template is heavily inspired by [Georgios's template](https://github.com/gakonst/dapptools-template). Over time it was migrated to use [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) since dapptools was deprecated.

### [Hitomi](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/hitomi)
Yet another Ethereum web3 console for any node.

### [Santoku](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/santoku)
It decodes ABI encoded hex strings into the original types. Try it [here](https://cleanunicorn.github.io/santoku/).

### [Mythos](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/mythos)
Mythos is a CLI client for the [MythX](https://mythx.io) API.

### [Flaterra](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/flaterra)
Flaterra parses the provided Solidity source file and adds any other `imported` files. This is useful if you want to upload your source code to a block explorer for verification, use it with [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) or to run analysis on it, for example with [MythX](https://mythx.io/) or [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril-classic/).

### [Midas](https://gitlab.com/cleanunicorn/eth-tipper) 
A [Discord](https://discordapp.com) bot that acts as an Ethereum wallet and facilitates sending Ether between users.

### [abi2signature](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/abi2signature)
Generates the Ethereum ABI 4 byte signature.

### [ranploy](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/ranploy)
Generates the EVM code to deploy the specified runtime bytecode.

### [artifaqt](https://github.com/consensys/artifaqt)
Social token collectible IRL game part of the [DevCon4](https://devcon4.ethereum.org/) Ethereum conference.
