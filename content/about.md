### Projects

### [Hitomi](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/hitomi)
Yet another Ethereum web3 console for any node.

#### [Santoku](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/santoku)
It decodes ABI encoded hex strings into the original types. Try it [here](https://cleanunicorn.github.io/santoku/).

#### [Mythos](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/mythos)
Mythos is a CLI client for the [MythX](https://mythx.io) API.

#### [Flaterra](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/flaterra)
Flaterra parses the provided Solidity source file and adds any other `imported` files. This is useful if you want to upload your source code to a block explorer for verification, use it with [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) or to run analysis on it, for example with [MythX](https://mythx.io/) or [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril-classic/).

#### [Midas](https://gitlab.com/cleanunicorn/eth-tipper) 
A [Discord](https://discordapp.com) bot that acts as an Ethereum wallet and facilitates sending Ether between users.

#### [Karl](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/karl)
Monitors smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum network and tests against vulnerabilities with Mythril. Reduces false positives by forking the blockchain and testing the exploit.

#### [abi2signature](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/abi2signature)
Generates the Ethereum ABI 4 byte signature.

#### [ranploy](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/ranploy)
Generates the EVM code to deploy the specified runtime bytecode.
